# Game-of-15
This is a project based off an old board game called the game of 15. It also goes by other many names, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle. The main objective is to sort numbered blocks in order from 1 to 15 on a 4x4 grid, but the catch is you can only move blocks using an empty space.
